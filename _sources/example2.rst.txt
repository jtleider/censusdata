Example 2: Downloading Data for All U.S. Counties
=================================================

Using the Detail Tables
-----------------------

For this example, letâ€™s suppose we have looked up the variables we need
by referring to the Table Shells. We begin by downloading the data and
checking the data we have received:

.. code:: ipython3

    import pandas as pd
    import censusdata
    pd.set_option('display.expand_frame_repr', False)
    pd.set_option('display.precision', 2)
    
    county65plus = censusdata.download('acs5', 2015, censusdata.censusgeo([('county', '*')]),
                                       ['B01001_001E', 'B01001_020E', 'B01001_021E', 'B01001_022E', 'B01001_023E',
                                        'B01001_024E', 'B01001_025E', 'B01001_044E', 'B01001_045E', 'B01001_046E',
                                        'B01001_047E', 'B01001_048E', 'B01001_049E'])
    county65plus.describe()

Then we keep the variables of interest, rename, and print descriptives:

.. code:: ipython3

    county65plus['percent_65plus'] = (county65plus.B01001_020E + county65plus.B01001_021E + county65plus.B01001_022E

                                      + county65plus.B01001_044E + county65plus.B01001_045E + county65plus.B01001_046E
                                      + county65plus.B01001_047E + county65plus.B01001_048E
                                      + county65plus.B01001_049E) / county65plus.B01001_001E * 100
    county65plus = county65plus[['B01001_001E', 'percent_65plus']]
    county65plus = county65plus.rename(columns={'B01001_001E': 'population_size'})
    county65plus.describe()

Finally, we show the 30 U.S. counties with the highest percentage aged
65+:

    county65plus.head(30)

Using the Data Profile Tables
-----------------------------

There is more than one way to approach this problem. Letâ€™s see how to
use the data profile tables for the same purpose. First, we identify the
appropriate table:

.. code:: ipython3

    censusdata.search('acs5', 2015, 'label', '65', tabletype='profile')[-25:]




.. parsed-literal::

After identifying the relevant variables, we download and describe the
data, and compute the percent 65+ similarly to how we did so before,
except now the computation is somewhat simpler:

.. code:: ipython3

    county65plus = censusdata.download('acs5', 2015, censusdata.censusgeo([('county', '*')]),
                                       ['DP05_0001E', 'DP05_0014PE', 'DP05_0015PE', 'DP05_0016PE',],
                                       tabletype='profile')
    county65plus.describe()

export data for all counties to CSV:

    county65plus.head(30)
